      I'm Jordan. I currently spend my days at Blue Agilis where I help build AI healthcare applications. My expertise spans fullstack web development, with significant experience in AI and blockchain domains.
      Outside of work, I enjoy roaming the streets of Staunton, VA on my One Wheel and playing Minecraft with friends.
