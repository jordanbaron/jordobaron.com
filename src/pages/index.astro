      Hello.
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm lg:text-base">
      I'm Jordan. I currently spend my days at Flex Moving &amp; Storage where I help build moving software. My expertise spans fullstack web development, with significant experience in AI and blockchain domains.
      Outside of work, I enjoy roaming the streets of Staunton, VA on my One Wheel, writing, and playing games, such as Minecraft and Rust, with friends.
